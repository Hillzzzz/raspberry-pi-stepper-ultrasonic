# raspberry-pi-stepper-ultrasonic
Ultra Step â€” A Raspberry Pi project combining an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor (via ULN2003 driver). Measures distance in real time and triggers precise motor movement when an object comes within range. Built in Python 3 using the rpi-lgpio backend for modern Raspberry Pi OS compatibility.
